# Gmgn-REMASTERED

v1.0
Still in early developement - adding features as I find time. If you find any bugs or have any ideas for more features, let me know.

## KEY FEATURES:
  - Price charts (supports all token launch platforms)
  - Watch Pump.fun livestreams directly from Gmgn
  - Token image and descriptions for supported platforms
  - You must enable 'X token search' under 'Customize -> Data' on Trenches for the price charts to work
  - Have your 'Layout -> Display' set to 'Moxia' for the best experience

## TODO:
  - switch between SOL and BSC on Trenches
  - remove Show charts only for Migrated
